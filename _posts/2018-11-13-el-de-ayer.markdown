# Introducing GraphFrames

Databricks is excited to announce the release of GraphFrames, a graph processing library for Apache Spark. Collaborating with UC Berkeley and MIT, we have built a graph library based on DataFrames. GraphFrames benefit from the scalability and high performance of DataFrames, and they provide a uniform API for graph processing available from Scala, Java, and Python.

## What are GraphFrames?

GraphFrames support general graph processing, similar to Apache Spark’s GraphX library. However, GraphFrames are built on top of Spark DataFrames, resulting in some key advantages:

* Python, Java & Scala APIs: GraphFrames provide uniform APIs for all 3 languages. For the first time, all algorithms in GraphX are available from Python & Java.
* Powerful queries: GraphFrames allow users to phrase queries in the familiar, powerful APIs of Spark SQL and DataFrames.
* Saving & loading graphs: GraphFrames fully support DataFrame data sources, allowing writing and reading graphs using many formats like Parquet, JSON, and CSV.
* In GraphFrames, vertices and edges are represented as DataFrames, allowing us to store arbitrary data with each vertex and edge.
